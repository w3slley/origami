Fixed network problem on ubuntu, April 23, 2019

A couple of weeks ago I fixed the problem I was facing regarding a problem with my labtop's wireless card. Before I couldn't access the university's wifi nor my own. Now I can do both.

I need to create a journal version of notes so that I can use it everyday. On it, only english will be used and it will be useful to store informations and notes about daily live. One option I could implement is a checkbox that sets the note title to the current date.

Mobile, January 27, 2019

Since I now can save notes without pressing buttons, the problem I was having with the mobile version becomes less complex. The only thing I still need to do is to create a config button that displays actions the user can perform, including delete the note.

Idioma, January 26, 2019

Em qual idioma eu deveria escrever as minhas anotações? Com o português, meu idioma nativo e o qual tenho mais facilidade, posso continuar praticando ainda mais minha capacidade expositiva e melhorar minha escrita. Já com o inglês é possível treinar ainda mais para criar outras obras nesse idioma, como histórias curtas, livros, ou até mesmo treinar para melhorar minhas habilidades linguísticas e de vocabulário na lingua inglesa.



Vou continuar pensando nesse assunto para chegar em uma conclusão.

Backup de notas!, January 25, 2019

Acabei de implementar o recurso de backup de notas. É algo bem legal e que demorou apenas uma noite para fazer. Como não necessita de nenhum input do usuário, nem me importei em utilizar prepared statements na interação com o Mysql. Talvez eu ainda consiga melhorar o script, mas depois dou uma olhada nisso.



É, de pouco em pouco o webapp vai ficando melhor. Vamos ver até onde ele vai chegar!

Atualizações :), January 24, 2019

Estou aqui novamente. Nesses últimos 6 meses eu meio que não mudei muita  coisa no Notes, ainda que nos último mês eu tenha dado uma mexida em certos aspectos do site. Hoje, 24/01/2019, eu voltei a lidar com a animação das notas quando clicadas e alterei algumas coisas (scrollbar, animações, etc). Também estou no processo de implementar outro feature: a possibilidade de fazer o download de todas as notas adicionadas. Considero esse um grande avanço visto que é uma forma de proteger todas as notas e salvá-las em um local que o usuário considera seguro. 

Quero falar com alguns amigos na universidade (que ainda nem conheci ainda kkk) para fazer alguma coisa com o notes: tentar transformá-lo em um webapp de produtividade empresarial ou algo do tipo. Vamos ver o que acontece. De qualquer forma, eu irei atualizando todo o processo por aqui (se não aqui, nas minhas anotações pessoais).

Planos - Porto e recursos financeiros, July 19, 2018

Estive pesquisando os preços para minha locomoção de lisboa para porto no início de setembro. Pelo que pesquisei, o meio mais em conta é o trem, que se eu comprar a passagem pelo site (precisa de um cartão de crédito) 10 dias antes eu tenho disconto de 65% (9,5 euros pelo que eu vi). É uma boa e eu consigo pagar barato para ir para lá. Tendo em visto os móveis que estou vendendo com a jheni, e se pelo menos grande parte deles forem vendidos, é possível juntar uns 1500 reais (se tudo for vendido, 2500 - se pouco, 1000). Pelo visto é possível vender a geladeira por 700-750, então aí já dá alguma coisa. Quero juntar pelo menos 400 euros para poder dar o calção e pagar a primeira parcela no quarto que vou alugar em porto. Pagando isso, já é possível estudar tranquilo (entre aspas...) pois a parcela de setembro já foi paga e a de outubro posso pagar até 31/10. O negócio seria vender mais coisas pra tentar juntar mais e ir se virando. Vou também, quando chegar em porto, verificar disponibilidade de horário - tenho que trabalhar e juntar dinheiro de alguma forma (como freelancer em web dev, ou trabalhando em restaurantes, qualquer coisa). Se tudo der certo e conseguir realmente estudar (não der nenhum problema com o visto nem nada), aí esses planos entram em ação. Muita coisa pode dar errado visto que não fiz tudo da maneira certa. Mas agora é fazer tudo o que posso para resolver o que preciso. 



Resumindo, preciso ter no mínimo 400 euros até o início de setembro (através da venda dos móveis, ou, em ultimo caso, pedindo para meus pais), já tenho que ter comprado a passagem de trem para porto e já tenho que ter alugado um quarto lá. Chegando lá, estudarei (se tudo correr certo) até novembro, em que tenho que voltar para lisboa e ir na entrevista do SEF. Irei provavelmente comprar a passagem de trem pelo menor valor tanto de ida como de volta para economizar. Se tudo der certo, vou arranjar alguma coisa para pagar o curso e minha estadia e poupar para pagar a passagem da jhenifer.



Além disso, irei levar a bicicleta para me locomover na cidade. Isso irá permitir que eu aluge uma casa mais longe da universidade se isso significar pagar menos no alugel. Já verifiquei no site do CP (comboios de portugal) e é possível levar a bicicleta sem pagar nada a mais. Neste momento, eu já vendi alguns móveis mas ainda faltam outros. Eu acho que dá pra chegar nos 350 euros (1500 reais). Vamos ver. Se isso acontecer, terei cerca de 500 euros no primeiro mês para pagar o primeiro mês do aluguel (no máximo 200 - mas quero que seja em torno de 150 a 170) junto com o caução. O resto eu irei poupar para pagar os outros meses.

MVC model, July 16, 2018

I'm learning the basics of Laravel (PHP framework) which uses the MVC model. For what I understood so far, the MVC model works by separating some functions to specific agents in the development of the web app. The model is responsible with the interaction with the database. The view is responsible for the presentation of the web page to the user - is what the user interacts with. And the controller is the "middle man", which takes data and inputs from the model and passes to the view layer - making sure the logic holds throughout the entire process and that the web app actually functions the way it is suposed to...

RESTful APIs, July 14, 2018

Stands for "Representational State Transfer" and are mechanisms to transfer data using HTTP requests between software applications. You can desing and code an application that can, for instance, use some data of google's servers - google maps, for exemple. So, you app can make a HTTP request to the google's server requesting some data about cities and latitute and longitude. Your application uses, in the end, the data comming from other software. In a nutshell, this is what RESTful APIs are.



API stand for "Application Programming Interface" and they are responsible to get and deliver data from other softwares. These concepts are pretty important when building a web application whose job is to interact with some other database or service (google maps, spotify, instagram, to name a few). And that's a good skill to have. That's why I'll learn it.

Notes app and future, July 14, 2018

I think the Notes web application is good. Not perfect, but good. In the process of developing this web app I learned a lot. Especially JavaScript. There's lots of mistakes in the code and it might not be the most reliable code you have ever seen. And I have to change that and learn how to make elegent and reliable code.



Now, since I think this is already "showable" to employers, I think I might stop improving it for now and go on to different projects. I have to learn a lot of things to become employable in the market. This is my main go right now. After that, I will think about other things. I might as well dedicate less time to network engineering because it is not what might give me a job soon. I know this line of thinking is naive. But for someone who does not have a job right now and it is not legal in a foreign country, that's what you get. I'll try to learn about networks in my spare time. But I'll focus on web development, because that's what will get me hired. I'll go back to laravel and make some projects with it. I was delaying it, but now I'll learn it because I need to. The job market here in portugal requires it (I know because it's all over the job postings around here - PHP as well). So I need to learn it.

Computer Network, July 13, 2018

What I appreciate about the  computer network and network engineering area is that you are working really close to physical phenomena (electricity and electromagnetism in this case) which is engineered to perform a specific task. To use physics to achieve a engineering goal is, in my opinion, a good way to spend your time.

RSA and asymmetric cryptography, July 13, 2018

The RSA (named after the peaple who created it) is a asymmetric crypto system that uses public and private key to encrypt and decrypt information. I already had learn about it but I forgot some of its feature ;D. The RSA algorithm uses modulo operations to make a mathematical relationship between the public and the private key. Every information that is encrypted using the public key can be decrypted using the private key. RSA and Diffe-Hellman are examples of asymmetric cryptography, but they work differently. The system is made so that the public key can only encrypt the data, not the other way. The private key can only decrypt the data. Asymmetric cryptography is used to solve (theoretically) the problem of exchanging keys securely between parties who want to communicate. It's also use to  verify the identity of those parties (if you encrypt a message and the other party can decrypt it, then they are who they said the are).



One thing to keep in mind is that symmetric encryption is way faster than asymmetric encryption. That's why public key cryptography is used to authenticate parties and symmetric encryption is used to actually encrypt data. So, to establish a TSL/SSL connection (application protocol for secure data communication) the client and the server have to agree about what symmetric key to use. To do that the server gives the client his public key. The client then encrypts the symmetric key with it and sends the cipher text. The server then decrypts it with his private key.

HTTPS on the server, July 13, 2018

Now the website is running with HTTPS! I added it using Let's Encrypt SSL certificate. For what I could learn about it, they do a pretty awesome job. Now every for every connection with users, the data transfered to and from the web server is encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security) which itself uses asymmetric cryptography to validate the server (to tell if it is who it says it is) and to transfer the cipher (keys) used to encrypt the data. I'm learning a ton of things theses days while I'm using the droplet from digital ocean. I think I'll use their service (if they don't screw anything) in the future. It's cheap as hell and you can do a lot of things with it. 



I have also got a domain name for the app. So in less than a day I have a domain name and I set up https. Good job.

 ########## 

New server!, July 09, 2018

I have now a VPS (virtual private server) from Digital Ocean. I got 2 months free to test the plataform and learn its features. I'm able to access the linux server via SSH. I have learned a ton about private and public SSH keys and how to use them to authenticate without using passwords (which are send in plain text form - allowing eavesdroppers, if any ;D, to see it). I have to be use to this technology because it's widely used and secure. It's really dope to be able to manage a machine in London using only the internet (with all its network and protocol structures). You feel very powerful.



One thing worth pointing out is that I changed the profile.js file in the server because the way it's today users cannot  signup and add notes. I have to fix the signup page and then I'll upload the changes. I also removed the feature of prevent the touch scroll in mobile devices. I changed both localy and in the server.



#Update:

Since I already did what I had to do in the signup page, the server is already up to date with the changes...

VLAN and Subnet - Network, July 07, 2018

VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is when a broadcast domain is limited to specific hosts in the network, separating them from the rest of the hosts in the LAN and creating therefore a apparent different network. When the computer tries to get the MAC address of other computers in the LAN, it will use ARP to broadcast data and find the destination host. In VLANs the broadcast domain will be limited to the ports you assigned to be part of that VLAN. It resides in the layer 2 (data link) of the OSI model. It reduces network traffic because hosts of different VLANs will not get the data from each other. It's also more secure as well.



Subnetting is when you create more than one  network inside another network. It resides in the layer 3 (IP) of the OSI model and uses the subnet mask to do its job. Depending on the subnet mask, you can vary the number of ip hosts you can have. So, if you use a Class C network with IP address 192.168.1.0/24 you can have up to 254 hosts (It would be 256, but 1 host need to be the network id and the other the broadcast domain). Its Network Id is 192.168.1.0 and its broadcast address is 192.168.1.255 and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0.  You can now split this network into two using subnetting. Now, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.128 (one bit is removed - in binary it goes to this: 11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000 and the number after the slash is the number of 1's in binary). After you do the subnetting, the network 1 (192.168.1.0/25) will have the Network Id at 192.168.1.0 and broadcast address at 192.168.1.127 and network 2 (192.168.1.128/25) will have the Network Id at 192.168.1.127 and broadcast address at 192.168.1.255.

 ########## 

Multiplexing - Network, July 07, 2018

When two devices "talk" to each other (send and recieve data), a socket is open. Sockets are the combination of the IP address of the parts, the transport protocol and the port used. So, if computer A wants to access a web server in computer B, a socket is open with the information needed (192.168.1.110, TCP, 102 for the computer A and 192.168.1.25, TCP, 80 for computer B since it's the web server and they are in the same LAN). The fact the computers can receive data and use for multiple applications at the same time is called multiplexing. Sockets have to be unique so that the data can be arrive to the correct destination/application. Multiplexing, thus, ensures the data arrives to the correct applications.



On the receiving end, the computer that it's wainting for the data neeeds to be "listening" to specific ports based on type of the connection. If it's a web server, the port number used is 80. If it's FTP, then the port number is 21, and so on. On the client side, it uses whatever ports are available.

 ########## 

Ethernet and UDP - Network, July 06, 2018

UTP stands for unshielded twisted pair and it's the most common type of wiring in ETHERNET networks (wired networks). The wires inside the cable are twisted to reduce EMI (electromagnetic interference) created by electric current. When you connect two nodes (devices) together, they have to "speak the same language" so that data can be transmited using electricity (for instance, for a current of certain voltage you count as a 0 and for a current of another voltage you count it as 1). The end of the cables is called RJ-45 (registered jack) connectors and they are connected to RJ-45 ports on the computer.



There're Ethernet physical layer standards used to transmit data. Some of the major ones include:



Ethernet -> Speed: 10Mbps(mega bits per second) ->10BASE-T (informal  IEEE standard name)->Copper, 100m.



Fast Ethernet -> Speed: 100Mbps -> 100BASE-T -> Copper, 100 m.



Gigabit Ethernet -> Speed: 1000Mbps -> 1000BASE-T ->Fiber 5 km.



10 Gig Ethernet -> Speed: 10Gbps ->10GBASE-T -> Copper, 100m.



In the 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T (Ethernet and Fast Ethernet) there're only two pair of cables (4 wires total), one to send and other to receive data. In the others, there are 4 pairs, 8 wires total. Each pair closes a circuit from one device (computer to computer or computer to router/switch) to the other.



As a rule, Ethernet NIC (network interface card) transmitters use the pair connected to pins 1 and 2; the NIC receivers use a pair of wires at pin positions 3 and 6. LAN switches, knowing those facts about what Ethernet NICs do, do the opposite: Their receivers use the wire pair at pins 1 and 2, and their transmitters use the wire pair at pins 3 and 6. Since the NIC is transmiting data on pins 1 and 2, the LAN switches recieve data in those pins. The same happens with the other pins.



The UTP cable uses a straight-through cable pinout (each wire is connected in the same pin in both ends - connects the wire at pin 1 on one end of the cable to pin 1 at the other end of the cable and so on).



The UTP cable can also use a cross-throught cable pinout. That happens when two like devices (two switches for instance) are trying to communicate with each other, but because they transmit data in the same pins, the crossover cable pinout crosses the pair at the transmit pins on each device to the receive pins on the opposite device.



Useful things to remember when it comes the data that is sended from one device to another:

Layer 2 = data frame.

Layer 3 = data packet.

Layer 4 = data segment.

Port forwarding, July 06, 2018

This is how you can access a web server that is on your local network from the internet. You have to port forward a specific port so that users from outside your network can access one of the hosts. If it is a web server, you forward the port 80 (HTTP), if it's FTP, you forward the port 21 and so on. This is what I'm going to do to make the Notes app available online in the future (while I don't buy a VPS).

Web development and Network engineering, July 05, 2018

When it comes to web development, I think I rather choose to spend more time improving this web app then jumping into another one. First because I learned a lot just by doing this from scratch. Second, I will improve this web app because I actually use it everyday. So, I need to implement some features I need. And third, I will continue to learn new things and new tools by doing that.



I have been learning about networks and their role in the modern society. Personally, I think that the internet is one of the most important creations of humanity. And it's a privilege to have been born in the middle of this. Also, almost everything I learned - from mathematics, physics, philosophy, music, computer science, you name it - I did on the internet. So I can say it was something that shaped who I am today. That's why I want to learn how the internet operates and, most important, to understand the ways you can protect yourself on it. With the widespread use of the internet, everyone who uses it can be a victim of people that want to use it to commit crimes. And I think it's right along with understanding the physical world I live in and to create new things as one of my passions.



So, in this past week I have been learning about networks and the devices that make up one. I even searched some certifications you can get to jump start you carrer in the industry. And with my degree in physics, I think I can start a internship in the area while studying - or, at least, that's one idea. 



What I am proposing is to continue to develop this web application and, in the meantime, study network and network systems with the material I downloaded. I'm by anymeans giving up at webdevelopment. In fact, that's what I'll continue to do (and I think now I have a solid understanding of front end and back end technologies - ready to just choose a framework and get to action). But along side with it I'll try to learn more about network engineering - a field that seems to be really good (both in the technical side and finantial one) and that it's completely possible to enter with my degree in physics. I know that I already planned something like this a thousand times so far (both when I was "choosing" between accounting and police force), but now the areas are the ones I really enjoy to be at - they all involve physics. And all of this, in my opinion, is a natural progression for someone who really likes to know the underline mechanisms of the internet: from the front-end part, to the back-end, to the server side logic, to the systems that allows servers to run and to the networks that make it all possible. 



I was planning to learn more about laravel and to develop something with it. In fact, it was what I planned in the weakly update of last sunday. But, I think learned the fundamentals of web development. Any framework, beeing a PHP or JS one, I think I could learn in a couple of weeks. Therefore, I believe that it's not that bad to stop the learning proccess with laravel to start to learn abour network engineering. It will only enhance my understanding of web development, at the very least.



Thus, nothing changed. I will continue to improve this application adding new features I need. In the end, I'll have a pretty badass web app to show to employers in the future (and at least two others: book app and Entenda mais website). So, if everything goes south I have something to show. I win no matter what: if the course didn't work out, I have all this work I have been doing for the past 3 months - plus the network knowledge I can use to find, at least, a help desk job somewhere. If all goes as planned, then even better. And if I enjoy the academia (I need to discuss this topic deeply in a later note), maybe I will pursuit grad school. But right now I really don't know. And before and fore most I have to find a job to pay the bills and to give back what mom deserves. But the great thing about these 3 months is that I have been learning something new everyday. And that is fucking awesome.



I have downloaded two books that cover the material needed to do the CCENT (Cisco Certified Entry Network Technician) and the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate). There, a lot of things are presented from the fundamentals of networking to TCP/IP models, ETHERNET, IPv4 and IPv6, routers and switches, and so on. I can take something between 4 hours a day to study it - half will go to developing the Notes app and the other half into studing it. That's what I'm going to do.

Subnet Mask - Network, July 05, 2018

The subnet mask separates the IP address into the network and the host address. Depending on the subnet mask, the available number of hosts in a network change. For instance, if the subnet mask of a network is 255.255.255.0, that means that only 254 (2^8 - 2 :you subtract two because the network and brodcast id use the first and the last values respectively) possible hosts can be created in the network (there's a byte of information left to assign numbers to hosts). If it is 255.255.0.0, that means that 65534 (2^16 - 2) - in this case, there's two bytes of information (different numbers) left to assing numbers to hosts. And so on...



 

 ########## 

Certifications - Network, July 05, 2018

I have been looking into the network engineering field and, due to the fact I'm really passionate about understanding the fundamental principles of the internet (one of the greatest inventions of humanity), I also am eager to learn about networks. The other reason is that I'm want also to understand the security part of the internet (to help me, and possibly others, to use the internet in a safe way). So, learning about networks and computer processes seems natural to me.



When it comes to enter the field (if the academia does not work out for me), I could do some internships while studying physics. And, in the mean time, study to get some certifications, some of them already listed in google keep. I know I already wrote this like a thousand times, but now it seems that this area of study (again, if academia doesn't offer what I expect) would be good for me (and the salary is nice as well). I already know some fundamentals of the internet - mostly the software part. Now, I can know how the hardware talks with the software and how it is builded and, in the end, apply those concepts into security and privacy on the web.



One thing to keep in mind is that I will still code websites - mostly because I like to create new things, like this app for instance. If everything goes wrong, I can get something with these skills.

 ########## 

OSI model - Network, July 05, 2018

I learned the OSI (Open System Interconnection) model. It describes the processes that occour in a network and separates them into 7 layers:

1)Physical ->all the wiring, cables and the physical part of the network. It's where the actual data transfer happens. All the bits transfered using electricity.

2)Data-link ->the switching part of the network (node-to-node data transfer). Assures that the data arrive to the host it is supose to go in the network.

3)Network -> allows to connect networks together - the routing part of the network (IP)

4)Transport ->where the control of packets of data from the host to the client happens (TCP)

5)Session ->the connections betwing devices in the network

6)Presentation ->Translates the data from the network into forms the application can understand

7)Application -> the applications the user interacts with (email, web browser, etc)



The 7th layer is the part the user interacts with - the lower the layer, the further away from the final user it is (in the sense that the user doesn't use it).



Just one comment. It's the Internet Protocol's job to give each computer it's address, to fragment the data into tiny packets and headers, and to deliver these packets to the destination in its original form. The TCP's job is to make sure every packet reaches the destination and do not get lost. This is why TCP/IP is named like this, because they work together to ensure that the data reaches the destination.



When it comes to the TCP/IP model (the original one, at least), there are 4 layers:

1)Application ->similar to the application, presentation and session layers in OSI.

2)Transport ->similar to the transport layer in OSI.

3)Internet ->similar to the network layer in OSI.

4)Network interface ->similar to the physical and data-link layers in OSI.



The current TCP/IP model has 5 layers:

5)Application-> protocols that applications (web browsers, email, etc) use to function correctly (HTTP, FTP, etc).

4)Transport->protocols that ensures the arrival and, when happens, recovery of the data between the hosts of the network (TCP).

3)Network->protocols that assure that the data transmitted arrives to the correct host of the network (IP).

2)Data link-> protocols that make sure the physical data (electric signals) gets to where it is supose to (using header and trailer).

1)Physical-> the physical data itself make of electrical signals. Also contain the wiring and cableing neccessary to then newtork to function properly.

Fixed computer - in part., July 04, 2018

Yesterday I managed to fix (somehow) the computer which was inactive for the last 5 months. I opened it and tried essentially to rip apart its parts to understand how it works. But, in the proccess of doing that the laptop suddenly turned on. The windows copy is busted though. I tried to install Linux Mint on it but some HD problems happened. I will try, later in the day, to install other linux distro on it and see how it goes. If it works, I will give it to mom so that she can use it.



I tried to install the Mint distro again but it didn't work. Now my plan is to download another linux distro and give it a try.



Yeah, I tried other linux distribution (open suse) but it didn't work. So I made a portable pen drive with good old Ubuntu and it worked. Now the PC is working fine - so far. Mom can already use it.

Data security and my own personal data., July 02, 2018

I'm moving my personal data and files to MEGA. To be honest, I will try MEGA for a period of time and see if the product is good. They offer an end-to-end encryption to the files you upload, using symmetric cryptography to secure that no one can have access to the data but you. The promise is good, but I already faced some issues with the plataform. Let's see how it all works and if it is a good choice for substituting google drive as my main database online. The reason I'm doing this is because I don't want to have all my data in only one place. And the more secure the media, the better. And I do that is not because I have something to hide or something like that. It is because I want to keep my information secure, only displaying the data to anyone I allow it. And no one should have the right to access it without my consent - only if it was needed, with approval, for legal purposes. In google, they would probably never even touch the files, and that is not what I am really concern about. I'm not by anymeans more important then anyone else to think they are seeing my files (I'm not that paranoid). But they could if they want. And I'll no longer put more trust in companies than they deserve to have. Google didn't commit, as far as I know, major errors when it comes to security of the data itself (being hacked, for instance - but when it comes to privacy and general they probably crossed some lines). And I believe customers should keep the companies (specially technology companies) accountable of their responsabilities. That's why I'm doing this. We will see how it turns out.

Thoughts on life and the future., July 01, 2018

Sometimes I stop to think about life. The time we have to live is, when you think about it, indeed short. And it becomes shorter when you compare to the lifespan of the the planet earth, or the universe, for instance. Right now I'm not really think about the grand scheme of things. I'm only trying to gather the knowledge that will give me a job to save money. But it's good to occasionally look at things with the big picture in mind.  Some times I forget that's something I have to live by. I want to know the reality I'm living in. But for that to happen, it's necessary to acquire financial means to save and live. And now is a time of planting. The seeds will become visible later on.



One of the things I enjoy doing the most is learn new things, especially things that make me understand more about the world I live in. But, as life teaches me, it doesn't matter what you know. What matters is what you do with what you know. I'm just typing letters in the keyboard right now - randomly trying to say something that matters for you in the future. I have to allways keep looking forward, and at the same time, enjoy the present. It goes by so fast. Sometimes that's good, sometimes it isn't. Time passes quickly. A few moments ago I was with someone I really enjoy spending time with. Now we are no longer close to each other. And each time along the way, it seems that I'm a different person. And I'm glad in the past, the person I was before, could spend some happily times - even though some other things were in the way and I wasn't in control. But I'm not in control right now either. For now. But I will be - at least of my own life. And I know sometimes this can be something of a delusion. But I believe that I need to try if I want to be happy. I don't know. There are a lot of things I need to know. And I'll learn them along the way. Just as I like spending time learning about the natural world, I need to constantly learn about how to live a happy and fulfilling life. And, in the end, that's what counts...

Updates on Notes, June 30, 2018

The web application is really good. I added the major features I wanted to add in the beginning: add, edit, delete and search notes, plus edit personal informations and upload a profile image. Today I finished implementing the loading animation in the bottom of the page and the AJAX code that displays more notes as soon as the user reaches the bottom of the page. I will use it more and more to discover bugs. There are still some features left for me to add (tags, for exemple). And I'll do so. But for now I will enjoy the app and use it. By the way, I will still use google Keep, but less often as I have now this app. The only thing I have to remember is to allways save the database scructure (and the data inside it) - probably on google drive. Good job mate.

Path in the internet industry, June 29, 2018

Sometimes I think about the areas I want to go in professionally. I have been, in the past 4 months, learning the fundamentals of the internet. By now, I can pretty much desing and implement a basic website. I have the skills to implement the front-end design (I'm not a fan of doing the design itself), to design the infrastructure of the database (using a DBMS and SQL), to create a server using VPS (accessing it through SSH) and the basics of cybersecurity. Though I have all this knowlegde about the entire chain, which is not by any means full or really advance, I plan to - if I indeed enter the area - focus on managing the database and to deal with the cybersecurity part of the web (for reasons I already explained somewere - probably on Keep). So, when I spend a lot of time creating my own projects, like this one, I will have to deal with the front-end even if that's not what I'll focus on. But I'll know how it works and it will be useful later on, somehow. Since I like to create, this is another way to do it, and now it is possible to give rise to new ideas and create them from scratch.

Search feature implemented!, June 29, 2018

Now you can search for notes you want using a term you know is inside it. It didn't take long to implement this. I will try to develop a search algorithm that uses AJAX, though. But, for now, the app it's pretty good actually.

Estratégias futuras - estudos., June 28, 2018

Faltam cerca de 2 meses para o início das aulas. Ainda não tenho recursos financeiros suficientes para pagar o aluguel em porto. Uma alternativa é vender tudo o que eu conseguir lá em sinop e juntar o máximo que eu puder. Eu posso vender o violão, os livros, alguns móveis - irei focar, entretanto, no que é meu, ou que é, em parte, meu. Irei começar a fazer isso no final do mês de julho. Também tenho procurar quartos para alugar em porto. Irei fazer isso na metade do mês de agosto.

Added some colors..., June 28, 2018

Today I added colors to the web app. I choose the color green since the icon is already in green. I changed the body background color as well and used a some what platinum color. I think it's dope. Now I need to change the note's color when editing it inside the modal. Will do this right now...



#Update

I changed the modal's color to a more bright green. I don't know if it's that good, maybe I'll change it later.

Thoughts on the web application and what I want to focus on., June 27, 2018

The Notes app is pretty decent. I need to find a good color palette to use in the design though. I'm not good on that stuff (of course I could always learn, but I'm not interested in.. Maybe becouse I want to focus on the back-end and in the security part of the internet).

There's a bug I need to fix, June 27, 2018

When the first note is added, it is not displayed in the browser without reloading. Have to fix this...



#Update: I'm not seeing this error anymore. ¯/_(ツ)_/¯

Going back to BookList, June 27, 2018

Today I'm improving some of the functionalities of BookList (I need to come up with a better name ;D). I already added a new font and made a few things look better. Now I'm going to add some animations to the notes. I also need to edit the index page - it's ugly as hell right now. Yeah, let's see how it goes.

NAT (Network address translation) , June 27, 2018

Eu acabei de descobrir o que é o chamado NAT e o papel que este desempenha na internet. Como o número de IP é limitado (cerca de 4.2 bilhões), é necessário achar uma forma de pelo menos temporariamente resolver o problema. O NAT serve para isso. Quando um dispositivo de uma rede local faz um request para um domínio na internet (com um IP público), o router faz a transição do endereço local para o público (apenas um IP que é o do router em si) e, só então, faz a requisição para a internet. Vamos supor que o dispositivo com IP local 192.168.1.161 faz uma requisição para o google.com. O router transforma esse IP local, que requere a página do google em determinada porta (vamos supor 6510 - número aleatório). 



Então, a requisição vem do dispositivo 192.168.1.161:6510. O router converte esse número em 87.115.64.25 que é o IP público que utiliza para se comunicar com a internet. Para isso, aquele IP privado é transformado em 87.115.64.25:54198 (outra porta) e esses dados são armazenados no que é chamado de NAT forwarding table. Assim, quando os dados voltarem do servidor do google, o router vai saber para qual dispositivo mandar esses dados, requisitando, logo, essa tabela. É assim que os routers conseguem funcionar utilizando apenas um IP público. A nova versão do IP (IP v6) vem resolver esse problema utilizando 128 bits de dados (o que dá 3,4*10^28, uma caralhada de endereços de internet - em comparação com os 4 bilhões da versão 4).

É por isso se eu tentar acessar o meu endereço de internet público, o browser é direcionado à página do router (que no IP privado é 192.168.1.1) e não tem como eu acessar meu servidor local (até agora, vou ver se isso é possível). Outra coisa que aprendi foi sobre o DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), o qual dá a cada dispositivo conectado na rede um IP local único, sem precisar que o sys admin faça isso manualmente!

Implemented more features, 

I am becoming more experienced with javascript while creating this web application. Right now, it has some interesting animations and interactions. The notes already are inside modals, when the user clicks to add a new note the title appears and the note becomes bigger, and so on. More on the implemented features in the update file. By the way,  I have to update it. (:D)

 ########## 

Some tansitions going on..., 

Today, 26/06, I added some transitions into the web app. Now, whenever the user adds a new note, or hover the mouse on top of it, it will display some transitions. I also added some shadows as well...

 ########## 

Testing the editing functionality, 

Right now I was able to implement the edit feature. That means that everytime the user clicks in a note, it will open the edit modal. It already saves the changes and all. The only thing I have to change is to make it change both in the database and in the browser when the user saves the changes without reloading the page. I will do this later. Now I'll update the update's file. (got it? hehehe)

Improvements in the app #2, 

Today, 25/06, I was able to implement some functionalities in the website. One of them was the modal that it is now displayed when the user wants to edit a note. It opens the edit section without reloading the page using AJAX and Javascript.  Right now, I have to insert manually the note's id in the code. However, I have to find a way to display the edit section for each note and, when the changes are made, the app needs to update both in the database and in the client side as well. I'm thinking in some ways to implement that.



Now it's all working fine...

 ########## 

About the application and the data from DB., 

I think I can store information and some notes here. Nobody but me has access to the database. Actually, I put it inside my GitHub account. Got to delete that later and leave only the schema for notes and users there. What I can do is to save in Google drive the actual data.

 ########## 

Some improvements I have to do, 

I have to add a navbar in the web app containing a place to search notes and an area to see personal information. The logout button will also be there. I also have to create a modal to edit the note on it. After that, I think the improvements need to be in the desing of the app and then the mobile experience...

 ########## 

Improvements in the app, 

Today I added some features into the website. Here are some of them: 

1) Made sure that the web app is usable in mobile devices.

2) Added the possibility to delete notes using AJAX.

3) Added loading animation in the authentication.



There's a lot of things to implement. But, for now, the app runs fine. Will add more features in the future.

IT industry and plans, 

I just had, this week, three interviews with three different companies in the IT business. I apply just to see how could it go and the response I would get. If everything goes wrong, and my carrer in physics don't go where I expect to, I can enter the web development industry to save money and try again. I really don't know what is going to happen. But in september my classes begin. I still don't know how to get 300 euros to cover my expense (rent and university), but I will try to do some freelancing in web development or other things. I have to get this money somehow. We will see how it goes...

 ########## 

Using AJAX to add notes, 

Now the user can add notes without the website reaload the page. It's pretty fast and it will remove the data from the input as soon as the user clicks the add note button. It's pretty awesome!

 ########## 

Testing vulnerabilities of network safety, 

I'm now aware of the command tcpdump on linux that allows you to see the trafic of data passing through the router. Right now I was able to see the password I just typed in to login! Holy shit. That's why you need to ensure security on the internet. Otherwise, all of your data can be seen by whoever wants it.

 ########## 

Update in Ubuntu!, 

Nice.. I'm using Ubuntu right now and right in this moment I just finished the migration of the database from win10 to Ubuntu just to learn how it's done. So far it all worked. I have all my notes I wrote. Let's see if everything is here.

 ########## 

Here I'm again, 

Checking the app again. Today, 05/06/18, I created the 5th project using the PHP language. I created a form that saves the text and resume inserted from a user to a server. It can be used (and it's already used) for employers to gather information about possible/future employees. Now that I finished it, I will watch a series of videos on Laravel by Brad from Traversy media - a great website to learn a lot a stuff related to web development.

 ########## 

Update, 

Now the app has some colors going on. Today I finished the process of re-coding the update_profile_img app using Object Oriented Programming. It's pretty decent. With it, I have already 4 projects with OOP PHP. I want to finish at least 5 projects to move on to learn to use JavaScript in the back-end (Node.js). 

 ########## 

Up and running., 

Now the app is pretty much done - I mean, the logic part of it. The user interface is still pretty shity. But, you already can add notes, edit them and exclude them. You can create an account and login and have all your notes saved in the app. Yeah, I wrote a lot of things but some error occour and they were deleted. Ok then... Let's see how it goes.

Oort Cloud - Wikipedia, 

The Oort cloud,  named after the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, sometimes called the Öpik–Oort cloud, is a theoretical cloud of predominantly icy planetesimals proposed to surround the Sun at distances ranging from 50,000 and 200,000 AU (0.8 and 3.2 ly). It is divided into two regions: a disc-shaped inner Oort cloud (or Hills cloud) and a spherical outer Oort cloud. Both regions lie beyond the heliosphere and in interstellar space. The Kuiper belt and the scattered disc, the other two reservoirs of trans-Neptunian objects, are less than one thousandth as far from the Sun as the Oort cloud.



This is another test. The problem, though, is that is really slow. I don't know why. I have to find out why. 



#Update:

I finally figure out. The problem was the spellcheck: you have to set its value to false. Now, it's all smooth and fast! hehe

 ########## 

Está indo de acordo com o esperado, 

É, aparentemente o aplicativo está funcionando como deveria. Falta implementar coisas como categorias, pesquisa, editar e excluir notas, etc. Porém, por enquanto está legal até.



#Update

Já consegui implementar funções como pesquisa, edição e exclusão de notas. Falta ainda as categorias. Tá bem filé até... Hehehe

 ########## 

Working, 

Now the break line functionality is working. I can press enter and it will be displayed when the user sees the note. Take a look:



Hehehe. Good job buddy.

 ########## 

Test 1, 

Another test!!



Testing break line.



Again.
