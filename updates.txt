14/06 12:55
Features done:
	1)Improved the styling of the login page.
	2)Implemented feature of adding notes without reloading the page!
	3)Implemented feature of deleting note without reloading the page. The only problem is that the browser doesn't exclude the note since it is already loaded. I have to do this somehow with javascript. Working on it.

25/06 18:49
Features done:
	1) Implemented the edit feature inside a modal without reloading the page. Now, everytime the user clicks the note, it will go to the edit section. Have to figure out a way to display images as well.
	2) Implemented delete feature. Now, when the user deletes a note it will be removed from the browser without reloading the page.

26/06 10:56
Features done: 
	1) Added animation in the notes' div. Now, when the user passes the mouse over the note, it will interect with it.
	2) Added animation in the 'add note' area (input and textarea). Now, when the user clicks in the textarea, it will slide down and the title input will pop up.
	3) Redesign the login page. It now displays a video, an introduction to the project and the login input.
	4) Redesign the note's modal. Now it looks similar to the Google Keep's design. I'm not trying to copy it. I just use as a reference.
	5) Was able to implement a feature so that when the user clicks out of the textarea, it comes back to normal (displays only the textarea with the placeholder "Write a new note..."). However, it isn't fully implemented (for now it only does something if the div 'notes' is clicked). Have to figure out a way to do what it is suposed to do while clicking anywhere outside the textarea!

Features done:
	1)Made the modal containing the notes more responsive. It's a little better on mobile as well, but I still have to fix some issues there.

Things I still have to implement:

1)add label system to the notes.(DONE)
2) Edit notes (DONE)
3)Delete notes (DONE)
4)Display the date of the creation of the note.(DONE)
5) add error handlers in the sign up and login.(working on it)
6) add error handlers in the add note section. (working on it)
7) Add images to the notes.
8) Make sure that when the user clicks out of the note, the note is automatically saved.
9) ADD a navbar with the search feature using AJAX.
10) When the first note is added, it is not displayed in the browser without reloading. Have to fix this...(DONE-I think... :D)
11) Display a fix amount of notes in the home page and, when scroll down to the last position, display more notes.(DONE)
11.2)Create loading animation in the bottom of the page. (DONE)
12) Fix the problem-> when deleting notes using the trash can, it opens the note because you need to click the div - and I set the command to open the note as soon the user clicks it.(in part DONE)
12.2) Make sure that when the user clicks to delete a note, the note has some animation of being deleted.
13) Make sure that when the user clicks outside the textarea, the title input fades away and the textarea shrinks in padding bottom. Right now it only does that if the div notes is clicked.(DONE)
14) Implement the profile page with user information and image.(DONE)
15) Create box that shows up when the user clicks the profile image in the navbar.
16) Insert the buttons in the side bar. (probably setting buttons and so on)
17) IDEA->Create a version of the app that encrypts the notes (a more secure alternative)
18) Create in the setting part a feature that allows the user to change the main color of the app among other things!
19) Make sure that when the user types something this is stores directly into the database without clicking the save changes button! This is important.
