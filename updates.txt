Features done:
	1)Improved the styling of the login page.
	2)Implemented feature of adding notes without reloading the page!
	3)Implemented feature of deleting note without reloading the page. The only problem is that the browser doesn't exclude the note since it is already loaded. I have to do this somehow with javascript. Working on it.
	
Things I still have to implement:
1)add label system to the notes.
2) Edit notes (DONE)
3)Delete notes (DONE)
4)Display the date of the creation of the note.
5) add error handlers in the sign up and login.
6) add error handlers in the add note section.
